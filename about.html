<p>Welcome to Lists and Plot Twists, a blog and podcast featuring the orderly and disorderly stories of life. As professionals we often come across women whose personal and professional stories, experiences and narratives leave us wanting to know more. </p>

<p>We wanted to create a broad collection of narratives that strike a chord, resonate and make us ponder. </p>

<p>This blog and podcast is a platform to show “the extraordinary in the ordinary”- from all walks of life, across the globe. This is an narrative, in an interview format,  focused on women who inspire through their life stories, lists and plot twists. </p>
